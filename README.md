# My pyplot-gallery

This is a small gallery of pyplot examples. Hopefully I can retrieve the sample codes and save some time in the future. 
Take a quick look at the following illustrations to see available samples. 

In addition, the file [style.py](submodules/style.py) contains useful functions to (globally) change the style for scientific publication LaTeX templates.
